Drag in issue:
Drag in didn't work when use texture for rendertarget. After a lot tests in Test.html I found I used a wrong way to update texture in material.
For regular texture and material it should like:
material.map.image.src = event.target.result;
material.map.needsUpdate = true;

For the shader material it should like: 
materialUI.uniforms.tSampler.value.image.src = event.target.result;
materialUI.uniforms.tSampler.value.needsUpdate = true;

I forgot .value before .needsUpdate so it didn't work.
The .needsUpdate only can be use on material which texture changed. For rendertarget texture, if still use same rendertarget you should not use .needsUpdate to update it.
